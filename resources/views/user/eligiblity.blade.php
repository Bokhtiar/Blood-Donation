                <h3>DONORS MUST:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Be at least 17 years of age (16-year-olds may donate blood with a parent/guardian’s consent). Donors under the age of 17 should bring the completed consent form (05-FX1) when registering to donate.
                    </li><br><br>
                    <li>
                        Weigh at least 110 pounds for donors 19 or older (Donors under 19 — see height/weight requirements)
                    </li><br><br>
                    <li>
                        Be free of cold and flu symptoms (allergies ok; as are most medications)
                    </li><br><br>
                    <li>
                        Eat before donating and drink plenty of fluids
                    </li><br><br>
                    <li>Fill out a Medical History Questionnaire (which will be provided at the time of your donation) and discuss answers confidentially with a Medical Historian</li>
                </ul>
                </div>

                <h3>Anyone 19-Years-Old or Older</h3>
                <p>For all heights, you must weigh at least:	110 lbs.</p>

                <h3>MEDICAL HISTORY</h3>
                <p>You will be asked to complete a Medical History Questionnaire each time you donate blood. Your honesty in answering these questions is a crucial part of the blood donation process. You may fill out your medical history questionnaire ahead of time on the day of your donation by using SBC preCheck™.</p><br>
                <p>Once you have completed your form, a Medical Historian will go over your questions and answers with you. They may ask for further information, and you will have the opportunity to ask any questions you may have. The Medical Historian will then determine, based on your answers, if you are eligible to donate blood that day. Here are some reasons why a donor may be permanently deferred:</p>
                <p>
                    HIV/AIDS :    You are a person with symptoms or laboratory evidence of HIV virus.
                    <br><br> Cancer :	You have had Leukemia, Lymphoma, multiple myeloma and all other hematologic malignancies.
                    <br><br> Heart Disease : 	You’ve ever experienced heart failure or coronary artery disease. Other heart conditions may require your doctor’s permission.
                    <br><br> Hepatitis : 	You have a history of the disease.
                    <br><br>  Organ Failure : 	You have experienced kidney, lung, or liver failure.</p>
