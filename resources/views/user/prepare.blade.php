                Donating blood is a safe, simple, and satisfying experience. Your donations help give life to the millions of Americans each year who require blood transfusions during surgery, after an accident, or because they have a disease that requires blood components. There are many different ways to donate lifesaving blood products, including whole blood, platelet, plasma, and automated red cell donation. The process usually takes about 45-60 minutes.

            <h2 class="h4 container">Preparation</h2>
            <p class="container" style="font-size: 20px">Eat at your regular mealtimes and drink plenty of fluids prior to donating. If you are donating platelets, do not take aspirin, or products containing aspirin, for at least 48 hours before your scheduled appointment.</p>
